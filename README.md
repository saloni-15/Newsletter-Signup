# Newsletter Signup

## About
The aim of this project was to learn to work with APIs. In this project we have used **MailChimp** as a platform to save the records such as emails and names of the clients who have subscribed our newsletter and add them to our audience using an API key generated by MailChimp.
Also in this project I get to know about the **Heroku: Cloud Application Platform**, to deploy our webapps.
